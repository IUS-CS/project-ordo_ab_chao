# Design patterns from team ordo_ab_chao: <h1>
## Introduction <h2>
### The design pattern to our Django website is MVT (Model-View-Template), and a standard architecture/design pattern for Django websites. This can further be elaborated on as also a simple factory method design pattern within the MVT design. The Template is the interface to the user, and the user uses to request a new object to be created through HTML forms (i.e. - Entry box to enter keywords to query by). The Template interacts with the View. The View handles the data flowing from the Model to the Template's UI(User Interface), and back. It's like a "middle man" in the interaction between the Template and Model. The Model handles the logistics of objects created, and eventually stored in the SQLite3 database. Any models in the Model must be registered with the Admin, so Django can do all the Server side database inserting, modifying, and deleting for the programmer. The programmer can make the website without ever directly dealing the the SQLite3 database. This is part of Django's simplicity and why it's such a great framework for programmers beginning web development. A image below show's the basic MVT design structure for our website. <h3>

## More Details on patterns <h2>
### The simple factory method makes sense for our website. The user enters into the HTML forms entry box and this makes a request to the View, and then to the model to create an object. This object is the keywords, parsed at whitespace, and put into a string array. The ebay-python-sdk then create a http request, to ebay's database, and then gets back JSON data. This data is processed and cut into a designer matrix and a target array. The designer matrix is put into a prediction model, and then the prediction model checks this against the target array. Then a new prediction array is output, as the "concrete product", and sent to the View. The View sends this, in the form of a graph, to the Template to be displayed. The factory method is widely used and makes the most sense for our Django website. <h3>
## The Future <h2>
### We continue to see this object-oriented user request, GET, process, predict, factory pattern in terms of how the behavior of the website is driven. The ebay SDK (Software Development Kit) has not been perfected yet, at this time. This process of retrieval from ebay's database may potentially change the design pattern of the website. We expect not much will change by the time this website is complete. <h3>
