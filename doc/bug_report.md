## BUG REPORT: <h1> 

* There was a bug using Google chrome/chromium to login to Django admin page (instead use Internet Explorer, Safari, etc., another browser other than Google Chrome/Chromium)

* There was a bug (on certain computers with Windows OS) trying to run the 'python manage.py runserver' command. The error will read 'Error: [WinError 10013] An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions'. The fix to this is to instead run the server on port 8080, using this command instead: python manage.py runserver 8080
