# Team Ordo Ab Chao Project reflections: 
  ## John Heinz
  I am not done working on the project yet, but I can comment on what has been done thus far. It's 
  quite possible and likely that not everything will get done in this project. If I can complete the blog 
  and the prediction models, then everything can be adjusted for django "production" phase and then put 
  live on the internet. The code is very sloppy and thrown together. Up to this point, most of the html 
  files do not extend from a common base.html when they could. This is a violation of the DRY principle 
  (DRY == "Don't repeat yourself"). A lot of the styles have been inlined in the html tags for convenience. 
  I wish I had more time to do more on this project. I seriously doubt that the prediction models, if any 
  get done in time, will be anywhere near accurate to be of any use to any users that visit the website 
  live. I hope to get some more work done and complete this project for being put up on the internet. If 
  I don't get that done before the end of the semester, I will likely finish the job of Christmans break.

  My experience over this semester is full with new learning experience with building and accomplishing the website. I have learned to use HTML, testing the web application. In addition, I had a positive experience with this class project and working with my teammates.
