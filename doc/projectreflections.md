# Team Ordo Ab Chao Project reflections: 
  ## John Heinz
  I am not done working on the project yet, but I can comment on what has been done thus far. It's 
  quite possible and likely that not everything will get done in this project. If I can complete the blog 
  and the prediction models, then everything can be adjusted for django "production" phase and then put 
  live on the internet. The code is very sloppy and thrown together. Up to this point, most of the html 
  files do not extend from a common base.html when they could. This is a violation of the DRY principle 
  (DRY == "Don't repeat yourself"). A lot of the styles have been inlined in the html tags for convenience. 
  I wish I had more time to do more on this project. I seriously doubt that the prediction models, if any 
  get done in time, will be anywhere near accurate to be of any use to any users that visit the website 
  live. I hope to get some more work done and complete this project for being put up on the internet. If 
  I don't get that done before the end of the semester, I will likely finish the job of Christmans break.
  > UPDATE: I have all three prediction models working, but that don't work correctly. Unforunately, I don't 
  have the time to play with the models and do actual tests to see if any of them predict prices at least pretty good. 
  I did add a 'Directions' and 'About Website' tabs explaining more about the website and some kind of background. I 
  wish I had more time to work on this website. It has been very challenging at times, but I pushed through all the 
  problems. I explain to others, sometimes, that WebDev is a "mine field" of all kinds of problems. It's very easy to 
  try to use a framework for creating a website and get problems immediately just trying to set it up. A lot of times, 
  this is due to the tutorial using an older out-of-date version of a web development framework, like Django. I wish all 
  future C346 Software Engineering students the best of luck, and don't give up so easy on making the project work.

  My experience over this semester is full with new learning experience with building and accomplishing the website. I have learned to use HTML, testing the web application. In addition, I had a positive experience with this class project and working with my teammates.

 Doing this project we got to know each other better by working together as a team. We always had an open and honest communication with the goal in mind of finishing the project. It may don't get done completely but we've had fun working together.
