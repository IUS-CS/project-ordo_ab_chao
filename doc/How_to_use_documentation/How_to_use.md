# How to use the software: 
## Home page
There are several different things to use on the home page. First is the "login" and "create account" at the top of the page. It's 
pretty self-explanatory. If you don't have an account, then click on the "create account" link to create a username and password. 
Once the account is created, when the user presses the submit button, it redirects to the login page. The user will then login and 
submitting with the submit button redirects back to the home page. Once on the home page, the user can enter in the keywords to 
search by. This website mainly caters to expensive high-end collectibles in the categories of: Trading cards, comic books, and coins. 
Below are some sample keyword searches to search by:
1. Example of trading cards below. Make sure to include a year, manufacturer, possibly card number, name, professionaly grading 
company and finally a grade consistent with that grader's scale.
#### Example one:
- 1979 Topps 18 Gretzky PSA 8
#### This example shows the year (1979), manufacturer (Topps), card number (18), last name (distinct enough to not get different results, as oppose to "smith" being the last name), grading company (PSA), and finally the grade being consistent with their standards (8).
#### Example two:
- 1985 Topps 8a Adam Bomb BGS 9.0
#### This example shows the year (1985), manufacturer (Topps), card number (8a), full name on card (Adam Bomb), grading company (Beckett Grading Service), and grade consistent with their grading scale (9.0).
2. Example of comic books below. Make sure to include a name of comic book (exact title), year, number of comic book, distinct keywords that 
differentiate that comic book from others that are similar in many ways (like first appearance or #1 issue), grading company, and grade 
consistent with that grading companies grading scale.
#### Example one:
- Amazing Fantasy #15 1962 Spider-Man CGC 3.5
#### This example shows the comic book title (Amazing Fantasy), number (#15), year of issue (1962), keyword stipulating "Spider-Man" (significance being its his very valuable first appearance in any comic book), grading company (CGC), and grade in accordance with grading scale at CGC (3.5).
#### Example two:
- Journey into Mystery #83 1962 Thor FA CGC 7.0
#### This example shows the comic book title (Journey into Mystery), number (#83), year of issue (1962), keywords (Thor FA, because it's Thor's first appearance, i.e.- "FA", and origin), grading company (CGC), and grade consistent with grading companies grading scale (7.0).
3. Example of coin below. Make sure to include the year, coin type, mint mark, any other keywords that are relevant, grading company, and the grade of the coin consistent with the grading companies grading scale.
#### Example one:
- 1895 Morgan dollar proof PCGS pr-60
#### This example shows the year (1895), type (Morgan dollar), mint mark not included because it's Philadelphia minted which is the default mint mark in older 19th century coins...so it's not necessary to state that, keywords relevant (proof, it's a proof and not for circulation in general), grading company (PCGS), and grade on encapsulation slab (pr-60).
## Blog
Any user that has an account and is logged in can create a blog. If the user isn't signed in, then the user will be redirecting to the login 
page to login first. Then redirected to the home page after logging in (this needs to be fixed for the blog page). Once signed in, the user 
can read all blogs by everyone. Currently, the search box in the navbar doesn't work. When it does, the search box can be used to sort 
through the blogs based on certain keywords in the title and/or blog message body. A user can also update/edit or delete a blog that was 
created by them (associated with that specific username and password only). Other users cannot edit and delete other user's blog posts.
