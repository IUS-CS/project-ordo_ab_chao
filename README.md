This team's project is to create a website, using DJANGO PROJECT, html/css/bootstrap, python. This website takes entry search words and returns several graphs from eBay data. The graphs are a time interal graph showing "sold listings" based on those search words, and three graphs showing predictions of future prices for those search words using a Artificial Neural Network, Multivariate Linear Regression model and OOS/"step forward anaylsis" model. This website is collectible themed. Professionally graded collectibles are highly recommended for the search strings.
