                    Trading cards in general is a very big subject. There are many different classes and sub-classes 
                    of trading cards overall. The most popular class of trading cards are sports cards. They fetch 
                    the highest values and professionally graded, high-demand, vintage sports cards are among the 
                    most collectible and expensive. The example to the left of the paragraph (image) is a 1979-80 
                    O-PEE-CHEE #18 Wayne Gretzky rookie card, graded by Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) a 9 MINT 
                    condition. Wayne Gretzky Topps and O-PEE-CHEE rookie cards are some of the most expensive, highly 
                    popular, collectible hockey cards in the hobby. The main categories of sport cards the draw the 
                    the most attention are baseball, football, basketball, hockey, golf and NASCAR racing cards. The 
                    most popular grading companies for trading cards are Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), Beckett 
                    grading services (BGS) and Beckett Vintage grading services (BVG), and Sports Card Guarantee (SGC).

                    The image to the right of this paragraph is an example of a 1980-81 Topps basketball #6 Larry Bird 
                    and Magic Johnson dual rookie card (of both Bird and Magic), professionally graded by Beckett grading 
                    service (BVG - Beckett Vintage Grading) an 8.5 near mint to mint plus condition. Another highly collectible, 
                    vintage, professionally graded card as an investment. Rookie cards almost always tend to the the most 
                    valuable, highly collected cards of a certain player. The most valuable vintage cards are almost always 
                    inductees into the correspoding sports' Hall of Fame. Rare short prints and very scarce cards take up most 
                    of the highly valuable cards, other than rookie cards. Professionally graded sports cards have had an upward 
                    trend in value in the past 20 years, while the mid-grade and low-grade counterparts have decreased in value. 
                    That even includes vintate, highly popular cards of hall of famers like a 1965 Topps Carl Yastrzemski or even 
                    a 1958 Topps Al Kaline.

                    There are many more highly collectible trading cards than just sport cards. To the left of this paragraph 
                    is an image of a 1985 Topps Garbage Pail Kids #8b Blasted Billy. Topps did not make a lot of copies of the 
                    first series, from 1985, of Garbage Pail Kids, hence high grades from companies yield hundreds, or even 
                    thousands of dollars. Other non-sports trading cards that are popular are Magic - The Gathering, Pokemon, and 
                    most any licensed trading cards made before 1970. Goudey made many non-sports sets, issued in packs with bubble 
                    gum in a wax wrapper. Topps made many issues of trading card sets during the 50's and 60's, including sets of 
                    The Beattles music band, tv shows like Lost in Space, and much more. Even the non-sports tobacco cards from the 
                    19th century command high prices, professionally graded 8 near mint to mint or higher.
